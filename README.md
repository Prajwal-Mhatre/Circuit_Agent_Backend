## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Required Dependencies

To run this RAG from backend, make sure you have Python and install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install llama-index-core
pip install llama-index-vector-stores-chroma
pip install llama-index-embeddings-huggingface
pip install llama-index-embeddings-openai  # Optional: Only needed if you use OpenAI for embeddings

pip install chromadb
pip install python-dotenv

```

**✅ Tip:** It's recommended to use a virtual environment (`venv`) to manage dependencies and isolate your project from global packages.



### ▶️ Running the Project

Once dependencies are installed, run the `main.py` script.
